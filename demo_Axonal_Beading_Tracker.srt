1
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:03,891
Hello this is a demonstration of the code

2
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:06,091
shared on this GitHub repository.

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:10,299
I have already cloned the repository to

4
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:12,979
my local folder. Let's have a look at its

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:13,859
contents.

6
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:18,206
This is the folder containing the time

7
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:21,126
lapse images. I am using only 40

8
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:22,566
images for this demo.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,110
And this is the destination folder.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,030
Outputs from 2 previous analysis are

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,990
already here.

12
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,418
Let's move on to the next item, the YAML

13
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:40,778
file which is used to configure the code

14
00:00:40,778 --> 00:00:42,338
for specific scenarios.

15
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:49,738
You can see the destination path here.

16
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:51,818
This is where the output files will be

17
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:52,498
saved.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,580
If you need a detailed output of the

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,540
analysis, set this to true. There are

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,820
also several other parameters that can be

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,580
tuned. For details, please

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,300
refer to the paper cited in the

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,220
repository.

24
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:11,064
This file contains the functions called

25
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,264
by the main script.

26
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:17,144
Now let's take a look at the main script.

27
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,251
This is the path to the source directory

28
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:24,611
currently hard coded to this folder.

29
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,107
To select the source interactively,

30
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,627
enable this line and disable the above

31
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:30,067
one.

32
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:33,498
Lets go ahead and run the main script.

33
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:38,072
First I need to activate the virtual

34
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:38,912
environment.

35
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:43,936
Next I'll move to the clone directory and

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,776
run the script.

37
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:54,993
The initial "just in time " ompilation

38
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,513
using  "NUMBA" may take some time.

39
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:00,433
Meanwhile, let's open the destination

40
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:00,993
folder.

41
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,151
The compilation is now complete and the

42
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:13,671
code is prompting me to select an Axon.

43
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:16,726
I'm selecting this Axon using mouse

44
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:19,726
clicks. If needed you can right Click to

45
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,646
remove all selected points.

46
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,661
Now press any key to continue.

47
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,094
You can see that the code is now

48
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,534
iterating through all the images and a

49
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:44,934
new folder has appeared in the

50
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,094
destination path.

51
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,415
The script has finished execution. Let's

52
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,052
check the contents of the output folder.

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,490
You can find 3 dot txt

54
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,330
files here. Let's open the file BEAD

55
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,010
chords dot txt.

56
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,139
This shows the coordinates of the

57
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:11,339
confirmed beads in each frame for the

58
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:14,219
selected Axon. Here we can see that

59
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,739
beading has started from frame number 13

60
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,459
onwards.

61
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:21,374
Moving on to the file bead parameters, it

62
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,654
contains the details of all the suspected

63
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:26,014
beads that underwent rigorous analysis.

64
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,175
Now let's move to the file. Rigorous

65
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,775
speed analysis. For each

66
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,095
suspected bead, it confirms whether it

67
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,575
was identified as a bead or not, along

68
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:46,335
with the reason if it was rejected.

69
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,048
Now let's quickly see how these output

70
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,128
data and files can be utilised.

71
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,871
Consider frame number 15. The file

72
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,991
shows that 2 beads were detected.

73
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,623
This should be shown in the rigorous

74
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,303
speed analysis file.

75
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,149
Now let's view these beads labeled as I

76
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,669
equals zero and I equals one.

77
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,169
Both the cropped bead and its detected

78
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,969
edges, along with the masks used can be

79
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:32,809
seen here.

80
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,793
Now let's look at the case K equals

81
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:40,793
14 and I equals zero where

82
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,673
a structure was rejected to be a bead.

83
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:49,956
When you look at the edges it can be seen

84
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,836
that there is no bead like swelling on

85
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:52,556
the edges.

86
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:56,688
Also, for each frame there is an

87
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,648
interactive HTML file. The

88
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,408
user can interact with it, see the

89
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,408
coordinates of the features, zoom into

90
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:05,168
the edges, etcetera.

91
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,595
There is also a plot of the diameter

92
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,955
along the Axon which allows the user to

93
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:21,435
see the peaks, their coordinates and

94
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,875
other related details.

95
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:28,264
Hope you found this demo useful. Thanks

96
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:29,104
for watching.
